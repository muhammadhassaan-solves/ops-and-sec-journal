I tried auomated Win-Acme Method but it was showing this error:
getting this error
System.Net.Http.WinHttpException (80072EFF, 12030): 
Error 12030 calling WINHTTP_CALLBACK_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR,
'The connection with the server was terminated abnormally'

most probably it was protocol issue. So, I did it manually.

1. Install openssl
https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

2. Get CSR from ZeroSSL

3. Place the validation txt file(http-01 method)
Open IIS Manager 
In Connections → expand Sites → select your site (abc.tech)
On the right panel, click explore
Create .well-known\pki-validation

4. Verfiy at the place of your domain 
http://abc.tech/.well-known/pki-validation/5556BEDE913B7B2A5881F97E4BE16A6B.txt

5. Download zip file of cert

6. Open Command Prompt and cd to the respective folder where you have extracted cert, ket and csr then use the following command
"C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" pkcs12 -export -out mycert.pfx -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt -certfile ca_bundle.crt

7. At the .pfc file in server certificates.

ProTip:
add port 443 and tick require server name indication if you want to host mulitple websites on 443 from same server.
